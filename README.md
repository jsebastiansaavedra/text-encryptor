# 🔒 Text Encryptor Web Application

Welcome to the **Text Encryptor Web Application**! This project is a simple yet powerful web app that encrypts text by altering the vowels and decrypts it in the same way. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this app showcases basic front-end web development skills with a touch of cryptographic fun!

## 🚀 Features

- **Encryption**: Transform your text by replacing vowels with specific characters.
- **Decryption**: Restore the original text from the encrypted version.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI for seamless interaction.
- **Lightweight**: No external libraries, purely vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔍 How It Works

The encryption works by replacing vowels in the text with specific characters:
- `a` ➡️ `@`
- `e` ➡️ `3`
- `i` ➡️ `!`
- `o` ➡️ `0`
- `u` ➡️ `^`

The decryption process reverses these replacements.
